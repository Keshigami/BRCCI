## Legal Compliance Summary

This property management system is designed with strict adherence to key Philippine property laws to ensure legal compliance and protect the interests of both landlords and tenants.

### 1. Civil Code of the Philippines (Property Rights, Contracts, Landlord-Tenant Obligations)
- **Compliance Features:**
    - **Lease Agreement Management:** The system facilitates the creation and storage of comprehensive lease agreements, ensuring all essential elements of a contract (consent, object, cause) are present and documented. This includes clear terms on rent, duration, and responsibilities, aligning with Articles 1642-1688 on Lease.
    - **Security Deposit Handling:** Explicit tracking of security deposits, including their amount, date received, and conditions for return or forfeiture, in accordance with Civil Code provisions on obligations and contracts.
    - **Maintenance and Habitability:** The Maintenance Tracking Module ensures that the lessor's obligation to make necessary repairs and maintain the property in a habitable condition (Article 1654) is met by providing a clear process for reporting, tracking, and resolving maintenance issues.
    - **Rent Payment Obligations:** The Rent Collection Module enforces the lessee's obligation to pay rent (Article 1657) through automated reminders and clear payment tracking.
    - **Eviction Procedures:** While the system does not execute evictions, its workflow for documenting and tracking eviction processes emphasizes the legal requirement for court orders, aligning with due process and tenant protection under the Civil Code.

### 2. Republic Act No. 9646 (Real Estate Service Act/RESA)
- **Compliance Features:**
    - **Licensed Property Managers:** The system is designed to be used by licensed property managers, brokers, or their authorized representatives. While the system itself doesn't license individuals, its features (e.g., detailed financial reporting, transparent record-keeping) support the professional and ethical standards required by RESA for real estate service practitioners.
    - **Transparency and Accountability:** The comprehensive financial reporting and audit trails within the system promote transparency and accountability in property management, which are core tenets of RESA.

### 3. Presidential Decree No. 957 (Subdivision and Condominium Buyersâ€™ Protective Decree)
- **Compliance Features:**
    - **Disclosure of Fees and Charges:** The system ensures that all fees and charges related to the property (rent, association dues, utilities, etc.) are clearly documented and disclosed to tenants and owners, preventing deceptive practices.
    - **Property Information:** The system can store and present detailed information about the property, including its legal status, which is crucial for compliance with disclosure requirements under PD 957, especially for condominium units.

### 4. Republic Act No. 4726 (The Condominium Act)
- **Compliance Features:**
    - **Unit-Specific Management:** The system's ability to manage individual units within a property (e.g., condominium units) allows for specific tracking of unit owners, tenants, and associated fees (e.g., association dues), aligning with the nature of condominium ownership.
    - **Common Areas and Facilities:** While not directly managing common areas, the system can track maintenance requests and costs related to individual units that might impact common areas, supporting the overall management of a condominium project.

### 5. The Rent Control Act of 2009 (Batas Pambansa Blg. 877, as amended)
- **Compliance Features:**
    - **Automated Rent Increase Calculation:** This is a core feature. The system automatically calculates and suggests rent increases based on the legally mandated percentage limits (e.g., 7% per year in Metro Manila, 10% elsewhere for residential units with rent up to a certain threshold), preventing unlawful increases.
    - **Rent Cap Enforcement:** The system can be configured to flag or prevent rent increases that exceed the legal caps, ensuring compliance with the Act's provisions.

### 6. Local Government Code of 1991 (Republic Act No. 7160)
- **Compliance Features:**
    - **Local Property Regulations:** The system's flexibility allows for the input and tracking of local ordinances and regulations that may affect property management (e.g., specific permits, local taxes, zoning regulations). While not automating all local compliance, it provides a centralized repository for relevant information.
    - **Business Permits and Licenses:** The system can track the validity and renewal dates of necessary business permits and licenses required by local government units for property management operations.

### 7. National Building Code (Presidential Decree No. 1096)
- **Compliance Features:**
    - **Maintenance and Safety:** The Maintenance Tracking Module, by ensuring timely repairs and addressing structural or utility issues, indirectly supports compliance with the National Building Code's provisions on structural stability, sanitation, and safety of buildings. Documentation of maintenance activities provides a record of efforts to maintain building standards.
    - **Habitability Standards:** By facilitating the upkeep of properties, the system helps ensure that rental units meet the basic habitability standards implied by the Building Code.
